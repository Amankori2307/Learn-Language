Perfect. I’ll write this like a **Product + Technical Requirement Document (PRD + TRD)** that you can directly paste into Replit AI or any code-gen tool.

This will include:

* Product vision
* Features
* User flows
* Database schema
* Algorithm logic
* API structure
* UI structure
* Edge cases
* Future roadmap

You can literally say:
**"Build this app exactly as described below."**

# 📘 PROJECT DOCUMENTATION

# Telugu Learning Quiz App (Adaptive + Cluster-Based)

---

# 1️⃣ PRODUCT OVERVIEW

## App Name

Learn Telugu – Adaptive Quiz-Based Learning

## Goal

Build a quiz-based Telugu learning app that:

* Starts with vocabulary
* Groups words into meaningful clusters
* Teaches through contextual sentences
* Uses adaptive spaced repetition
* Improves retention using an algorithm

---

# 2️⃣ CORE LEARNING PHILOSOPHY

Learning flow:

```
Words → Clusters → Sentences → Quiz → Adaptive Repetition → Mastery
```

The system should:

* Show weak words more often
* Hide mastered words
* Detect confusion patterns
* Reinforce via sentence examples

---

# 3️⃣ USER FLOW

## Onboarding

* User selects:

  * Beginner / Intermediate
* Creates account
* Starts with Level 1 Core Vocabulary

---

## Home Screen

Options:

* Continue Learning
* Daily Review
* Practice by Cluster
* Weak Words
* Progress Dashboard

---

## Quiz Flow

1. Show question
2. Show 4 options
3. User selects
4. Show:

   * Correct / Incorrect
   * Correct answer
   * Example sentence(s)
   * Optional audio playback
5. Ask confidence level:

   * Guess
   * Somewhat Sure
   * Very Sure

---

# 4️⃣ QUESTION TYPES

System must randomly rotate:

1. Telugu → English
2. English → Telugu
3. Fill in the blank
4. Sentence meaning
5. Audio recognition (optional advanced)

---

# 5️⃣ CONTENT STRUCTURE

---

## Word Model

Each word must contain:

```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "telugu": "నేను",
  "transliteration": "nēnu",
  "english": "I",
  "partOfSpeech": "pronoun",
  "difficulty": 1,
  "exampleSentences": [
    "నేను ఆపిల్ తింటాను."
  ],
  "audioUrl": "",
  "tags": ["basic", "pronoun"]
}
```

---

## Cluster Types

### 1. Semantic Clusters

* Fruits
* Family
* Emotions
* Actions

### 2. Grammar Clusters

* Pronouns
* Verb forms
* Conjunctions
* Question words

### 3. Confusion Clusters

Words that are often mixed:

* నేను vs నువ్వు
* ఇది vs అది

### 4. Functional Clusters

* At restaurant
* Asking directions
* Shopping

---

# 6️⃣ DATABASE DESIGN (PostgreSQL)

---

## Table: users

```sql
id UUID PRIMARY KEY
email TEXT UNIQUE
password_hash TEXT
created_at TIMESTAMP
```

---

## Table: words

```sql
id UUID PRIMARY KEY
telugu TEXT
transliteration TEXT
english TEXT
part_of_speech TEXT
difficulty INTEGER
audio_url TEXT
created_at TIMESTAMP
```

---

## Table: clusters

```sql
id UUID PRIMARY KEY
name TEXT
type TEXT -- semantic, grammar, confusion, functional
```

---

## Table: word_clusters

```sql
word_id UUID REFERENCES words(id)
cluster_id UUID REFERENCES clusters(id)
```

---

## Table: sentences

```sql
id UUID PRIMARY KEY
telugu TEXT
english TEXT
difficulty INTEGER
```

---

## Table: user_word_progress

```sql
user_id UUID
word_id UUID

correct_streak INTEGER DEFAULT 0
wrong_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0
ease_factor FLOAT DEFAULT 2.5
interval INTEGER DEFAULT 1
last_seen TIMESTAMP
next_review TIMESTAMP
mastery_level INTEGER DEFAULT 0

PRIMARY KEY (user_id, word_id)
```

---

## Table: quiz_attempts

```sql
id UUID PRIMARY KEY
user_id UUID
word_id UUID
is_correct BOOLEAN
confidence_level INTEGER
created_at TIMESTAMP
```

---

# 7️⃣ ADAPTIVE LEARNING ALGORITHM

Use simplified SM-2 Spaced Repetition.

---

## When Answer is Correct

```
if correct:
    correct_streak += 1
    ease_factor += 0.1 (if confidence high)
    interval = interval * ease_factor
```

Update:

```
next_review = now + interval days
```

---

## When Answer is Wrong

```
correct_streak = 0
wrong_count += 1
interval = 1
next_review = now + 1 day
```

---

# 8️⃣ WORD SELECTION ALGORITHM

When generating quiz:

Score each word:

```
score =
    difficulty_weight
  + days_since_last_seen
  + (wrong_count * 2)
  - correct_streak
```

Sort descending.
Pick top N.

This ensures:

* Weak words appear more
* New words appear
* Mastered words disappear

---

# 9️⃣ MASTERING LOGIC

| Correct Streak | Mastery Level |
| -------------- | ------------- |
| 1              | Learning      |
| 3              | Familiar      |
| 5              | Strong        |
| 7              | Mastered      |

If mastered:

* Show only during review cycles
* Not in regular quiz pool

---

# 🔟 QUIZ OPTION GENERATION LOGIC

For a word:

1 correct answer
3 distractors

Distractor priority:

1. Same cluster words
2. Same part of speech
3. Similar transliteration
4. Random fallback

This increases difficulty intelligently.

---
