# Learn source language App - Active Execution Context

This folder is intentionally compact and keeps only active context.

## Primary references

1. `context/plan/APP_CONTEXT.md`: current product scope and supported features.
2. `context/plan/02-code-guidelines.md`: modularity + enum/interface coding standards.
3. `context/plan/01-master-task-registry.md`: active backlog only (no completed tasks).
4. `context/plan/40-phase-4-release-gate-checklist.md`: phase-4 beta release gate evidence and decision.
5. `context/plan/55-phase-4b-critical-fixes-and-review-governance.md`: active detailed phase doc.
6. `context/plan/58-phase-4c-words-first-and-sentence-feedback.md`: words-first learning flow implementation spec.
7. `context/plan/60-phase-5-media-expansion-last.md`: deferred media-phase backlog.
8. `context/plan/82-docker-setup.md`: Docker usage and hot-reload notes.
9. `context/plan/99-daily-run-log.md`: latest progress snapshot and resume pointer.

## Operating rule

- Keep text-first learning quality as top priority.
- Keep only active/required context files in this folder.
- Move forward strictly in task order from the active registry.
