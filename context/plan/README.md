# Learn source language App - Active Execution Context

This folder is intentionally compact and keeps only active context.

## Primary references

1. `context/plan/APP_CONTEXT.md`: single source of truth for current app scope, architecture, workflows, constraints, and priorities.
2. `context/plan/02-code-guidelines.md`: modularity + enum/interface coding standards.
3. `context/plan/01-master-task-registry.md`: active backlog only (pending/in-progress tasks only).
4. `context/plan/60-phase-5-media-expansion-last.md`: deferred media-phase backlog.
5. `context/plan/99-daily-run-log.md`: latest progress snapshot and resume pointer.
6. `context/plan/00-execution-protocol.md`: sequencing and stop/resume protocol.

## Operating rule

- Keep text-first learning quality as top priority.
- Keep only active/required context files in this folder; archive completed-phase docs under `context/archive/`.
- Move forward strictly in task order from the active registry.
