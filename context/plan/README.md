# Learn Telugu App - Active Execution Context

This folder is intentionally compact and keeps only active context.

## Primary references

1. `context/plan/APP_CONTEXT.md`: current product scope and supported features.
2. `context/plan/01-master-task-registry.md`: active backlog only (no completed tasks).
3. `context/plan/55-phase-4b-critical-fixes-and-review-governance.md`: active detailed phase doc.
4. `context/plan/60-phase-5-media-expansion-last.md`: deferred media-phase backlog.
5. `context/plan/82-docker-setup.md`: Docker usage and hot-reload notes.
6. `context/plan/99-daily-run-log.md`: latest progress snapshot and resume pointer.

## Operating rule

- Keep text-first learning quality as top priority.
- Keep only active/required context files in this folder.
- Move forward strictly in task order from the active registry.
